# Our jobs run like this to minimize wasting resource cycles:
#   1. Prime caches for primary configuration (ubuntu on node 14).
#      This way the next two jobs can run in parallel but rely on this primed
#      cache.
#   2. Lint and coverage
#     a. Lint
#     b. Coverage
#   3. Run tests for remaining configurations
#      Since these don't share caches, we don't need to prime those caches.
